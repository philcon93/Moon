Hey there, my name is Phil,

I am a hard working designer that has a keen eye for detail and works strongly in group environments. I approach any tasks with enthusiasm and ready to continue to learn and develop my skills through the task that I am presented with.

As a graduate that spent the final year of my university studies simulating an indie games studio, I am excellent with managing teams, using different software technology and applying my design knowledge.

JS | jQuery | HTML | CSS | SaSS | LESS | Node | Wordpress | Neto | Git

For anymore information of my experience or about myself, feel free to contact me via Linkedin or email; connah_93@hotmail.com.
